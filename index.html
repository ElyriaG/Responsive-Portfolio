        <p>
            <img src="assets/images/profile.JPG" alt="Me" ; width="20%">
            I was born in 1993, in Chicago, but grew up in the suburbs.
            I live with my parents, older brother, and younger sister.

            <br><br>

            I went to NIU to study nursing and French, but ended up dropping nursing in my
            junior year and only got a Bachelors in French. Which was a mistake, because the only thing you
            can do with a bachelors is teach, which I did not want to do. I was debating interpreting but
            that requires a certification which I also did not want to do. So after working for a year, I decided to go
            back to school for nursing and actually finish. Unfortunately, I still had a few pre-req's to do, few being
            2-5, depending on where I wanted to study. So I took two classes, but it was going too slow for my taste.
            Eventually I heard about coding bootcamps, did some research, and here I am. Woo.

            <br><br>

            Apart from work and school, I like to go rock climbing, play spider solitaire on my phone, go hiking, watch
            Marvel movies, consider the meaning of life and fail, annoy my cat, plan my best friend Beth's birthday
            gift, and bake cookies. Oh, and organize fridges. Well, one fridge.
